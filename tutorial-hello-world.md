# Clarity: Hello World Tutorial

To complete the tutorial, you should have NodeJS installed on your workstation. To install and run the starter project, you need to have at least version 8.12.0. You can verify your installation by opening up your terminal and run the following command:

> node --version

A version >= v8.12.0 should be returned, indicating that a compatible NodeJS release is installed.

## Step 1: Downloading starter project

In this step, you initialize a starter project for Clarity development:

1. Using your terminal, run the following command:
> npm init clarity-starter

2. After the starter project was loaded up, you have to select a template and a name for your local project folder. Feel free to hit ENTER both times to accept the default suggestion.
>  ? Template - one of [hello-world, counter]: (hello-world)

Finally, after the project dependencies have been installed, your project is ready for development.
